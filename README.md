**Bitcoin · Gifts** — turn your Passport Prime into a printing press for bitcoin gifts.

Paper Wallet generates classic "satoshi bill" gift wallets entirely offline. Each bill carries a brand-new private key born in the device's hardware random-number generator — never derived from your wallet seed, so a gifted bill can never endanger your own funds. The app renders the key onto print-ready artwork with two QR codes, and exports a PNG plus a backup file to wherever you want to print from.

Bills are fully compatible with the [bitcoin-gift-paper-wallet](https://github.com/ObjSal/bitcoin-gift-wallet) web app: recipients sweep with the same guided flow, and givers recover unswept gifts with the same recovery page.

## The bill

A print-ready 1843×784 PNG. The left QR is the deposit address — load and verify the gift. The right QR is a sweep link that opens the web app's guided sweep flow with everything pre-filled. The private key is printed on the top strip, the address on the bottom band, and the generation timestamp runs up the right edge.

> These sample bills are rendered from **publicly known test keys** — do not send funds to them. The app-screen captures likewise show throwaway simulator keys that never held funds.

## Features

- **Three gift styles** — **SegWit** (`bc1q…`, sweeps in any wallet), **Taproot** (`bc1p…`, modern and wallet-importable), and the flagship **Taproot + backup**: the recipient sweeps with the key on the bill, while *you* keep a separate backup spend path to recover an unswept gift.
- **Backup keys that survive anything** — the giver's backup keys are derived from the device master seed. A factory reset plus seed-phrase restore re-derives every backup key; the gift keys themselves stay pure hardware randomness, invisible to anyone restoring the phrase.
- **Design your own bill** — the satoshi artwork is just the default. Export the built-in design kit, restyle the template in any image editor, and the app validates and renders your custom design with the same engine as the original.
- **Save it your way** — a full save-as browser across Internal, Airlock, and USB with folder creation, custom filenames, and overwrite protection (a bill names a unique key — the app won't let two collide).
- **A gift ledger without secrets** — the saved-gifts list keeps each gift's address, type, and creation date with **no private keys stored**; the backup key is re-derived and shown only on demand, exactly when recovery needs it.
- **Offline by design** — Prime has no network stack. Sweeping, balance checks, and broadcast intentionally stay in the companion web app.

## Get it running

With the Foundation SDK installed, build and launch in the simulator with:

```bash
foundation sim
```

See **[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md)** for environment setup, the crypto stack, the bill-template format, testing, and permissions.

A paper wallet is a **bearer instrument**: anyone who holds the bill — or a photo, scan, or copy of it — can take the funds. A lost or destroyed bill with no backup key is unrecoverable. Nobody can reverse a bitcoin transaction or restore keys for you.
